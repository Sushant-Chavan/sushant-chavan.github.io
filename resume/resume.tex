\cvevent{Senior Software Engineer}{Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited}{Sep 2013 -- Dec 2017}{Bangalore, India / Hildesheim, Germany}
% Fulfilled various roles as a C++ \& 3D computer graphics developer. I was responsible for the design and development of next-gen, enhanced 3D navigation map graphics features, that are optimized to run on low-end embedded in-vehicle infotainment systems.
\begin{itemize}
    \item OpenSceneGraph \& Navigation Data Standard (NDS) based 3D map visualization application for in-vehicle infotainment systems
    \item Implement highly optimized algorithms for rendering 3D building models on embedded devices with limited computing power
\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Relevant Projects}

\cvevent{Composable Ontology-based Indoor Semantic Map}{Master Thesis, Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel framework to flexibly compose new maps from a prior collection of heterogeneous metric-semantic indoor maps
    \item Employ an ontological knowledge-base together with the composed maps to plan context-dependent indoor navigation plans
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Simulator for modular KELO ROBILE mobile robots  \hfill \githubproject{https://github.com/kelo-robotics/robile_gazebo}}{KELO Robotics GmbH}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A ROS package to simulate arbitrary configurations of modular mobile robots in Gazebo with an option to activate true physics-based wheel motion, resulting in the motion of the platform
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Comparative evaluation of experience-based path planners for multi robot Systems \hfill \githubproject{https://github.com/Sushant-Chavan/coordination_oru\#experience-based-planning}}{Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Port and quantitatively evaluate the suitability of using single robot experience-based path planners for a fleet of logistic\\robots, using a custom-developed benchmarking framework
\end{itemize}

% \cvevent{Development of RViz plugins for RoboCup teams}{b-it-bots, Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg}{Oct 2018 – Jan 2019}{}
% %\begin{itemize}
% %	\item We developed a \textit{Map Annotation Tool} that eases annotating robot navigation maps with goal poses, by allowing storage, retrieval, and editing of navigational goal markers.
% %	\item We developed a \textit{Action Client Panel} that eases the task of sending goals to an action server. The panel provides a GUI for selecting actions, setting their parameters, sending action goals and monitoring progress of action execution.
% %\end{itemize}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  We developed two RViz plugins called \textit{Map Annotation Tool} and \textit{Action Client Panel}. The map annotation tool facilitates annotating navigation maps efficiently and flexibly. The action client panel provides a GUI for selecting actions, setting their parameters, sending action goals and monitoring the progress of action execution.
