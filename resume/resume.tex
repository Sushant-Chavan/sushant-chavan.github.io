\cvsection[page1sidebar]{Career Objective}
%Software engineer with a 4+ years of rice experience working on low-end embedded devices in the car infotainment industry. 
Pursuing a master's degree in autonomous systems with 4+ years of professional experience in the  software development industry. Seeking a student job in the field of semantic mapping/navigation and multi-robot systems.

\cvsection{Experience}

\cvevent{Wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft (Research Assistant)}{ROPOD Project, Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg}{June 2019 -- April 2020}{Sankt Augustin, Germany}
Developed software for simulating a multi-robot fleet management system. Implemented continuous integration tests for evaluating the coordination and resource usage by the robot fleet.

\divider

\cvevent{Senior Software Engineer}{Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited}{September 2013 -- December 2017}{Bangalore, India}
Fulfilled various roles as a C++ \& 3D computer graphics developer. I was responsible for the design and development of next-gen, enhanced 3D navigation map graphics features, that are optimized to run on low-end embedded in-vehicle infotainment systems.

\cvsection{Projects}

\cvevent{Master Thesis - Composable Ontology-based Indoor Semantic Map}{Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg}{December 2021 – June 2022}{}

A novel framework to flexibly transform and merge a prior collection of heterogeneous metric-semantic indoor maps, that can be used in conjunction with a knowledge-base to plan context-dependent navigation plans that allow the robot to overcome some open-challenges in indoor robot navigation.

\cvevent{Comparative analysis of Experience Based Path Planning Frameworks for Multi-Robot Systems}{Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg}{December 2018 – August 2019}{}

\begin{itemize}
	\item We ported three experience-based planning frameworks (Lightning, Thunder, and EGraphs) to solve multi-robot path planning problems and quantitatively compared them using a custom-written benchmarking framework. 
	\item Our goal was to evaluate the suitability of experience-based planners in the context of the ROPOD project, where a fleet of multiple robots is assigned a task to pick up and deliver several supply-carts to different locations in a hospital environment.
\end{itemize}

% \cvevent{Development of RViz plugins for RoboCup teams}{b-it-bots, Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg}{October 2018 – January 2019}{}
% %\begin{itemize}
% %	\item We developed a \textit{Map Annotation Tool} that eases annotating robot navigation maps with goal poses, by allowing storage, retrieval, and editing of navigational goal markers.
% %	\item We developed a \textit{Action Client Panel} that eases the task of sending goals to an action server. The panel provides a GUI for selecting actions, setting their parameters, sending action goals and monitoring progress of action execution.
% %\end{itemize}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  We developed two RViz plugins called \textit{Map Annotation Tool} and \textit{Action Client Panel}. The map annotation tool facilitates annotating navigation maps efficiently and flexibly. The action client panel provides a GUI for selecting actions, setting their parameters, sending action goals and monitoring the progress of action execution.
